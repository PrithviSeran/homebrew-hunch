    <<~EOS
      One-time setup (macOS permission grants + browser profile):
        hunch setup
        hunch doctor
        hunch connect claude-desktop   # or: claude-code, cursor

      macOS trust attaches to the app that RUNS the server (your MCP host),
      not to hunch itself — `hunch setup` walks you through it.
